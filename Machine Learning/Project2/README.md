# Is Fandango Still Inflating Ratings?
In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest (Fandango is an online movie ratings aggregator). He published his analysis in this article â€” a great piece of data journalism that's totally worth reading

we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.

# Data Description
We'll work with two samples of movie ratings:the data in one sample was collected previous to Hickey's analysis, while the other sample was collected after. Let's start by reading in the two samples (which are stored as CSV files) and getting familiar with their structure.

# Other Info

Programming Language: Python.

Environment: Jupyter.

# Conclusion
Our analysis showed that there's indeed a slight difference between Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2015 and Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2016. We also determined that, on average, popular movies released in 2016 were rated lower on Fandango than popular movies released in 2015.

We cannot be completely sure what caused the change, but the chances are very high that it was caused by Fandango fixing the biased rating system after Hickey's analysis.
